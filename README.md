# Quizzical App
This the last project from the Scrimba react free course, it was really fun, and challenging, I used styled-component for the first time, and man I was missing out a lot,it make the code easier to maintain, but honestly the code that I wrote is complex, I wonder if my comments will explain it in the right way to another developer.
